### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist currently producing insights relating to how and why people move around and between organisations.

This repository is mostly for R code that I have created in support of this, but will no doubt also contain some side projects.

Current areas of interest

-- Targets package - in order to stremaline data preparation pipeline for predictive projects
-- Survival analysis - reviewing how well this informs decision miaking relating to employee retention

Things I would like to do more of

-- Report creation through RMarkdown and Shiny
